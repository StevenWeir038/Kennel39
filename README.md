## Scenario

A business tends to perform better with a steady stream of customers. It can accept walk ins and/or utilise some sort of appointment booking system.  At its simplest, this could be using a phone with a handwritten diary to record client names and their booking times.

Consider *Kennel39*, a small startup business (albeit fictional) whose only employee is its sole trader/owner.
Phone calls to book appointments can occur at anytime during business hours. Such calls can be difficult to take when lathering shampoo into someone's favourite pooch.

One solution is to increase automation.  It could be more convenient for the business to have customers book an appointment using a webform. This method has the advantage that appointments can also be made outside standard working hours.  In theory, this increases accessibility to business services thus improving productivity and turnover.

Another valid concern is that some people prefer to book a service passively using the web as opposed to making a phonecall, especially those of a shy disposition or from a younger generation as they are accustomed to this way of working.

Finally, a business with a professionally developed website tends to do better than its peers.  This is because new and existing customers gain a better insight of ethos, facilities and services on offer.  Confidence equals engagement.

With the above in mind, let's help The Kennel!
