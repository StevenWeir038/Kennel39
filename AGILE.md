### Reflections

Several false starts.
Got more comfortable using an Agile tool to plan functionality.  Applied retrospectively to 1st week objectives to practice how it works.

This was effectively the first iteration for the project before any real coding took place.

In a way I'll already started categorising user stories by area such as navigation or account management.  This gives an idea to the separate apps what will need to be created.

I found I was jumping from one task to the next with no real direction.  Best to plan each future iteration to make it easier to track what still needs to be done.
