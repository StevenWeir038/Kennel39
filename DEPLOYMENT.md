# Deployment

This project was a first attempt at deploying to *Heroku* and was done as early as possible to avoid undue stress closer to the submission deadline.

Full disclosure, it took a few iterations to get it working.

It is assumed the user knows how to create a repository on Github.
The linked repo template from the [Code Institute](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) was used to start the project.

To create a deployed a skeleton application on *Heroku* using Github/Gitpod IDE the folowing steps were observed:

1. Install Django 3.2 (LTS) with required packages
2. Create a new Django project
3. Set up project to use a relational database (PostgreSQL) and Cloudinary (for persistent file storage)
4. Deploy empty project to Heroku
